Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for error details. Please note the following : - This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for an available SNMP service. - Providing valid credentials for all available authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of successful authentication for a given protocol may vary from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that protocol.
